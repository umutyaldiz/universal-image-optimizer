## Installation

Install the Universal Image Optimizer globally using npm:

npm install -g universal-image-optimizer
```

---

## Usage

Universal Image Optimizer works with two primary commands:

### 1. Initialize Configuration File

To create a default configuration file in your project directory, run:

```bash
npx universal-image-optimizer init
```

This will generate a file named `image-optimizer-config.js` in your project directory with the following content:

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
};
```

### 2. Optimize Images

After setting up the configuration file, run the following command to optimize your images:

```bash
npx universal-image-optimizer start
```

This will process images based on the configuration file and save them to the specified destination.

## Logs and Messages

This tool uses color-coded messages for better clarity, powered by `picocolors`:

- **Success (Green)**: Indicates successful image optimizations.
- **Warnings (Yellow)**: Alerts you to potential issues, such as missing directories.
- **Errors (Red)**: Displays issues with configuration or file processing.
